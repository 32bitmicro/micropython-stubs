# Legacy installation

Prior to publish the stub packes to PyPi, the only option was to copy or clone the entire repository to a local drive and reference the different stub types from there.
that method has been depricated, but I wanted to keep the documentation just in case that is still usefull for someone.

Note however that I will not be activly maintaining these pages.

    Create a `stream` wrapper which allows transparent decompression of
    compressed data in another *stream*. This allows to process compressed
    streams with data larger than available heap size. In addition to
    values described in :func:`decompress`, *wbits* may take values
    24..31 (16 + 8..15), meaning that input stream has gzip header.

       This class is MicroPython extension. It's included on provisional

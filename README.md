Stubs of common MicroPython modules to aid in code completion, static typechecking and overall development
This repo stores stubs generated by the [MicroPython-Stubber](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubber) tool.

I invite everyone that has generated stubs for a board not on the current list, to submit the stubs via a spull request or by just zipping up your stubs and creating an issue.
Whatever works best for you.

## using the stubs 


### Windows 10 
requires  Developer enabled or elevated powershell prompt 
``` powershell

# target must be an absolute path, resolve path is used to resolve the relative path to absolute
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "all-stubs" -Target (Resolve-Path -Path ../micropython-stubs/stubs)

```
## firmwares 
The list of the current included firmwares, ports and boards is listed on the [**Firmwares page**](firmwares.md) 



## Credits 
To the creators of the software , and to the poeple that have submitted stubs or other relevant pieces of code and information.

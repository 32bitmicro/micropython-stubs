This repo stores stubs generated by the [MicroPython-Stubber](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubber) tool.
Currently over a 1.000 stubfiles of common MicroPython modules are stored to aid in code completion, static type checking and overall development using micropython.

I invite everyone that has generated stubs for a board not on the current list, to submit the stubs via a spull request or by just zipping up your stubs and creating an issue.
Whatever works best for you.

## List of current firmwares and stubs 
The list of the current included firmwares, ports and boards is listed on the [**Firmwares page**](firmwares.md)  

This includes stubs from the following micropython families: 
 - MicroPython
 - Loboris port (ESP32)
 - Pycopy
 - M5Stack
 - EV3 / Lego
 - Pycom (soon)

## Using the stubs 

In order to use the stubs you need to do a few things:  
 1.  download a copy of this repo , either via `got clone` or by download a zip file with it's contents
     - store this in a folder, for example 'next to' your software projects such as in `c:\develop\micropython-stubs`  
     this contains a `stubs` folder that contains all stubs

 2. over time you may want to periodically update this folder using `git pull`

### For each project where you want to use the stubs (Manual configuration) :   
this is not as complex as it seems. P

 1.  **Create a symlink folder to `c:\develop\micropython-stubs\stubs` inside your project**

 2.  copy the [samples](doc/samples) folder to your project.  
 this contains the base files you need to improve syntax highlighting and linting.

 2.  **Select which stub folders you need to reference**  
     - The order will influence results. place the 'higer quality' folders first.
     - Use forward slashes `/` rather than backslashes, also on Windows.
     - for example for micropython 1.13 on an ESP32 select:
         1. "./src/lib",
         2. "all-stubs/cpython_patch",
         3. "all-stubs/mpy_1_13-nightly_frozen/esp32/GENERIC", 
         4. "all-stubs/esp32_1_13_0-103",
 3.  **Configure vscode to use the selected stub folders**  
     This instructs vscode to consider your libs folder and the stubs for static code evaluation
     - use the [`.vscode/settings.json` sample file](docs/samples/.vscode/settings.json) located in the sample folder
     - place the folders in the 3 sections. each section should contain the same folders. it can be on a single line or split across lines. just make sure it is a valid json array 
          ```
          "python.autoComplete.extraPaths": [
               "./src/lib", "all-stubs/cpython_patch", 
               "all-stubs/mpy_1_13-nightly_frozen/esp32/GENERIC", "all-stubs/esp32_1_13_0-103",
          ],
          "python.autoComplete.typeshedPaths": [
               "./src/lib", "all-stubs/cpython_patch", 
               "all-stubs/mpy_1_13-nightly_frozen/esp32/GENERIC", "all-stubs/esp32_1_13_0-103",
          ],
          "python.analysis.typeshedPaths": [
               "./src/lib", "all-stubs/cpython_patch", 
               "all-stubs/mpy_1_13-nightly_frozen/esp32/GENERIC", "all-stubs/esp32_1_13_0-103",
          ]
          ```
 3.  **Configure pylint to use the selected stub folders**  
     This instructs pylint to inster the list of paths into `sys.path` before performing linting, thus alloing it to find the stubs and use them to better validate your code.
     - use the [.pylintcr sample file](docs/sample/.pylintrc) located in the sample folder
     - edit the line that starts with `init-hook=`  
          ``` ini
          init-hook='import sys;sys.path[1:1] = ["src/lib", "folder1","folder2", "folder3",];'
          ```
     - replace the folders with your selection of stub folders. **In this case they MUST be on a single line**
     - the result should look like:
          ``` ini
          init-hook='import sys;sys.path[1:1] = ["src\lib", "all-stubs\cpython_patch","all-stubs\mpy_1_13-nightly_frozen\esp32\GENERIC", "all-stubs\esp32_1_13_0-103",];'
          ```
 4.  **Restart VSCode**  
     vscode must be restated for the Python language engine and Pylint to read the updated configraton.
     you can use: 
     - the `Developer: Reload Window` command.
     - or stop / start the editor


## Create the symbolic link to the `micropython-stubs/stubs` folder
Note: The below examples assume that the micropython-stubs repo is cloned 'next-to' your project folder.
please adjust as needed.


### Windows 10 
Requires `Developer enabled` or elevated powershell prompt.

``` powershell
# target must be an absolute path, resolve path is used to resolve the relative path to absolute
New-Item -ItemType SymbolicLink -Path "all-stubs" -Target (Resolve-Path -Path ../micropython-stubs/stubs)
```
or use [mklink](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/mklink) in an (elevated) command prompt
``` cmd
rem target must be an absolute path
mklink /d all-stubs c:\develop\micropython-stubs\stubs
```

### Linux/Macos/Unix

``` sh
# target must be an absolute path
ln -s /path/to/micropython-stubs/stubs all-stubs
```

## Credits and contributions
Thanks to everyone that has submitted stubs or other relevant pieces of code and information, or published relevant stubs on pypi or github.

Stubs of common MicroPython modules to aid in code completion, static typechecking and overall development

This repo stores stubs generated by the [MicroPython-Stubber](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubber) tool.

I invite everyone that has generated stubs for a board not on the current list, to submit the stubs via a spull request or by just zipping up your stubs and creating an issue.
Whatever works best for you.

## current boards and stubs 

| Folder                | family | version| Description    
------------------------|--------|--------|-----------------
| cpython_core          | any    | any    | modules that patch the standard cpython modules to look more like theyr MicrpPython counterparts
| esp32_1_12_0          | mpy    | 1.12   | ... 
| esp32_1_12_0_frozen   | mpy    | 1.12   | rich stubs precisly targeted based on the manifests.py used in the build process
| esp32_1_11_0          | mpy    | 1.11   | ... 
| esp32_1_11_0_frozen   | mpy    | 1.11   | rich stubs precisly targeted based on the manifests.py used in the build process
| esp32_1_10_0          | mpy    | 1.10   | ... 
| esp32_1_10_0_frozen   | mpy    | 1.10   | No Stubs , as the manuifests were only introduced after v1.10
| pycopy_frozen         | pycopy | ....   | ....


## types of stubs 

- chip_X_X_X_frozen  - stubs for fozen modules are generated using a copy of the modules. These make for rich code completion including parameters and comments if provided in the source. 


## Credits 
To the creators of the software , and to the poeple that have submitted stubs or other relevant pieces of code and information.

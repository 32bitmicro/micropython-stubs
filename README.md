# micropython-stubs
Stubs of common MicroPython modules to aid in code completion, static typechecking and overall development

This repo stores stubs generated by the [MicroPython-Stubber](https://github.com/Josverl/micropython-stubber) tool.

I invite everyone that has generated stubs for a board not on the current list, to submit the stubs via a spull request or by just zipping up your stubs and creating an issue.
Whatever works best for you.

## current boards and stubs
